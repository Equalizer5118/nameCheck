You might rightfully be asking "Equal, why are you catching every exception? Isnt that a bad practice?"
and normally, yeah, it is. The problem is that my school computers won't let us open up CMD.
My home PC does, but my school desktop doesn't. As such, if an exception occurs at school during the 
initial window setup, the console closes immediately and I cant see the error. So, I made this little
script, which will catch every error and then display it in the console. That way, 
I can actually see the error instead of having to guess at what died.

Basically, screw you school district.
